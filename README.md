# Linux-Shell-And-System-Calls

## Problem Statement:
It is required to implement a Unix shell program. A shell is simply a program that conveniently allows you to run other programs. Read up on your favorite shell to see what it does.

### Your shell must support the following:

##### 1. The internal shell command "exit" which terminates the shell

• Concepts: shell commands, exiting the shell.

• System calls: exit()

##### 2. A command with no arguments

• Example: ls, cp, rm ...etc

Details: Your shell must block until the command completes and, if the return code is
abnormal, print out a message to that effect.

• Concepts: Forking a child process, waiting for it to complete and synchronous execution.

• System calls: fork(), execvp(), exit(), wait()

##### 3. A command with arguments

• Example: ls –l

• Details: Argument 0 is the name of the command.

• Concepts: Command-line parameters.

##### 4. A command, with or without arguments, executed in the background using &

• Example: firefox &

• Details: In this case, your shell must execute the command and return immediately, not
blocking until the command finishes.

• Concepts: Background execution, signals, signal handlers, processes and
asynchronous execution.

• Requirements: You have to show that the opened process will be nested as a child
process to the shell program via opening the task manager found in the operating
system like in figure 1. Additionally you have to write in a log file when a child process is
terminated (main application will be interrupted by a SIGCHLD signal). So you have to implement an interrupt handler to handle this interrupt and do the corresponding
action to it.
